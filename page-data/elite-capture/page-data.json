In Frazier’s time, there were class differences among African Americans, but exceedingly few black Americans had notable political power or the level of wealth that could buy serious influence. But that has changed, as Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor points out:</p>\n<p>The most significant transformation in all of black life over the last fifty years has been the emergence of a black elite, bolstered by the black political class, that has been responsible for administering cuts and managing meager budgets on the backs of black constituents.</p>\n<p>This transformation was dramatically on display in Baltimore during the protests of the murder of Freddie Gray. Taylor continues: <strong>“when a black mayor, governing a largely black city, aids in the mobilization of a military unit led by a black woman to suppress a black rebellion, we are in a new period of the black freedom struggle.”</strong></p>\n<p><em>(Source: <a href=\"https://bostonreview.net/race/olufemi-o-taiwo-identity-politics-and-elite-capture\">https://bostonreview.net/race/olufemi-o-taiwo-identity-politics-and-elite-capture</a>)</em></p>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"title":"Elite Capture","date":"November 16, 2020","description":"Race, economics and more (In progress...)"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/bet-maker/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"2021 Plans"}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"e04ba168-b9df-5a09-aaaf-d137c1d1ee54","previousPostId":"84c317c2-62f4-5471-bfd0-2fc1764d3186","nextPostId":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","2916120403"]}
